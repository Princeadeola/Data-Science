 List
We create a list by placing elements inside square brackets [], separated by commas. For example,

 # a list of three elements
ages = [element1, element2, element3, ...]

Note:
    in Python, lists can store data of different data types.
    We can use the built-in list() function to convert other iterables (strings, dictionaries, tuples, etc.) to a list.
