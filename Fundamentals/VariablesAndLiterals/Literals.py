"""
Literals are representations of fixed values in a program. 
They can be numbers, characters, or strings, etc. 
For example, 'Hello, World!', 12, 23.0, 'C', etc.

"""
Python Numeric Literals
Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: 
Integer, Float, and Complex.

1. Integer Literals
Integer literals are numbers without decimal parts. It also consists of negative numbers. For example, 5, -11, 0, 12, etc.

2. Floating-Point Literals
Floating-point literals are numbers that contain decimal parts.

Just like integers, floating-point numbers can also be both positive and negative. For example, 2.5, 6.76, 0.0, -9.45, etc.

3. Complex Literals
Complex literals are numbers that represent complex numbers.

Here, numerals are in the form a + bj, where a is real and b is imaginary. For example, 6+9j, 2+3j.
"""

"""
Python String Literals
In Python, texts wrapped inside quotation marks are called string literals..

"This is a string."
We can also use single quotes to create strings.

'This is also a string.'
"""

"""
Python Boolean Literals
There are two boolean literals: True and False.

For example,

is_pass = true  
Here, true is a boolean literal assigned to is_pass.
"""

"""
Character Literals in Python
Character literals are unicode characters enclosed in a quote. For example,

some_character = 'S'
Here, S is a character literal assigned to some_character.
"""

"""
Special Literal in Python
Python contains one special literal None. We use it to specify a null variable. For example,

value = None

print(value)

# Output: None
"""

"""
Collection Literals
Let's see examples of four different collection literals. List, Tuple, Dict, and Set literals.

# list literal
fruits = ["apple", "mango", "orange"] 
print(fruits)

# tuple literal
numbers = (1, 2, 3) 
print(numbers)

# dictionary literal
alphabets = {'a':'apple', 'b':'ball', 'c':'cat'} 
print(alphabets)

# set literal
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i' , 'o', 'u'} 
print(vowels)

In the above example, we created a list of fruits, a tuple of numbers, 
a dictionary of alphabets having values with keys designated to each value 
and a set of vowels.
